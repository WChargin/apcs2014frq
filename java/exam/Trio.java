/**
 * The class designed for Question 4 of the 2014 APCS FRQs. The menu at a lunch
 * counter includes a variety of sandwiches, salads, and drinks. The menu also
 * allows a customer to create a "trio," which consists of three menu items: a
 * sandwich, a salad, and a drink. The price of the trio is the sum of the two
 * highest-priced menu items in the trio; one item with the lowest price is
 * free.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Write the {@code Trio} class that implements the {@code MenuItem} interface.
 * Your implementation must include a constructor that takes three parameters
 * representing a sandwich, salad, and drink.
